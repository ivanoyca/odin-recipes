    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons oil</li>
      <li>1 onion, diced</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 1/4 pounds 93% lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Melt butter with oil in a deep cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add minced garlic and ground beef; cook and stir, breaking up the meat with a spatula, until beef is crumbly and browned, about 7 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir in tomato sauce and evaporated milk. Add pickle relish, Dijon mustard, granulated garlic, granulated onion, Montreal steak seasoning, chili powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper, and stir to combine.</li>
      <li>Reserve 1/4 cup beef broth, and pour remaining beef broth into the skillet. Whisk flour and the 1/4 cup beef broth together in a small bowl to make a slurry; stir slurry into the skillet.</li>
      <li>Stir in dry macaroni until pasta is fully submerged. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, covered, until macaroni is tender with a bite, about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Set a rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the ovenâ€™s broiler.</li>
      <li>Stir 2 cups cheese into macaroni mixture. Sprinkle remaining cheese evenly across the top of the skillet. Broil until cheese is golden, about 3 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
